# **Hello Hackers!!**

Inside this folder we have included some of the data stream from our game _Sky: Children of the Light_. It is player data taken from the first level of our game _Isle of Dawn_.

If you have any questions, advice, want swag, or just want to hang out please come visit us at our booth ðŸŽ‰

## Challenge

Sky has an amazing and vibrant community of socially minded players, and we are tirelessly working to ensure that players feel safe and supported. As with any online system, we are not immune to bad actors attempting to undermine our game ecosystem and platform. While we do not request identifiable information from our players and we make significant efforts to protect their privacy, we do track certain events in Sky in order to improve our player experience. For this challenge, weâ€™ve provided a set of 3D player telemetry data, including the time and position of movements, chat messages, instruments played, hands held, items purchased, etc. Our challenge is to come up with a novel way to use, interpret, or visualize this data, potentially in the service of identifying player relationships, threats to player safety (negative behavior, harassment), or other bad actors (such as hackers or bots), but participants should feel free to take it in any direction they think is most interesting.

### Criteria

Projects will be judged based on the following questions:

- How novel is your solution?
- What sort of insights does your solution enable?
- How could your hack help support the community?

## Mini example of aggregating some of the data:

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const readline = require("readline");

const readStream = fs.createReadStream("dawn-event-data.json", "utf-8");
const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: readStream });

async function loadDataset() {
  let skyEventCount = 0;
  const eventTypeCountAggregation = {};
  for await (const line of rl) {
    if (line.startsWith("[") || line.startsWith("]")) continue;
    const cleanedLine = line.trim().replace(/,$/, "");
    const data = JSON.parse(cleanedLine);
    skyEventCount += 1;
    for (const [key, count] of Object.entries(data.events)) {
      if (eventTypeCountAggregation[key] === undefined)
        eventTypeCountAggregation[key] = 0;
      eventTypeCountAggregation[key] += count;
    }
  }
  return { skyEventCount, eventTypeCountAggregation };
}

loadDataset().then((data) => {
  console.log(`read everything. result is ${JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}`);
});
```
